Personal, handwritten notes from some CMU math classes. I made scanned copies of them for fearing of losing pieces of paper here and there.

I have uploaded them because they could be useful for future reference/ self-study/ deciding whether the following classes are worth taking. All errors are mine.

Contents:
- [x] 21-355 Real Analysis I (Notes)
- [x] 21-355 Real Analysis I (Summary)
- [x] 21-373 Algebraic Structures (Notes)
- [x] 21-373 Algebraic Structures (Summary)
- [x] 21-378 Fixed Income (Technical Results)

Textbooks suggested for these classes were:
- Principles of Mathematical Analysis (<i>Baby Rudin</i>)
- Abstract Algebra, Dummit & Foote
- Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets, Tuckman & Serrat
