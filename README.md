# Lecture notes and other small work

## xx-xxx_*.pdf

Personal, handwritten notes from some CMU math classes. I made scanned copies of them for fearing of losing pieces of
paper here and there.

I have uploaded them because they could be useful for occasional reference/ self-study/ deciding whether the following
classes are worth taking. All errors are mine.

Contents:

- [x] 21-355 Real Analysis I (Notes)
- [x] 21-355 Real Analysis I (Summary)
- [x] 21-356 Real Analysis II (Summary)
- [x] 21-356 Real Analysis II (Summary)
- [x] 21-373 Algebraic Structures (Notes)
- [x] 21-373 Algebraic Structures (Summary)
- [x] 21-374 Field Theory (Notes)
- [x] 21-378 Fixed Income (Technical Results)
- [x] 21-469 Computational PDE's (Notes)
- [x] 21-469 Computational PDE's (Summary)
- [x] 80-413 Category Theory (Notes)
- [x] 80-413 Category Theory (Summary)

Textbooks suggested for these classes were:

- Principles of Mathematical Analysis (*Baby Rudin*), Rudin
- Abstract Algebra, Dummit & Foote
- Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets, Tuckman & Serrat
- Introduction to PDEs: A Computational Approach, Tveito & Winther
- Category Theory, Awodey
